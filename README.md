Hey 3307 markers. I attached a shell file "compileAndRun.sh" that has the line of linux code that I used to compile my assignment.

As you can see, I had a folder for the source files, and for the header files. Then I stored my main program in the assignment directory with teh summary.csv. So if there are any problems setting this up, it might be due to the locations, but I am certain it will work.

I hope you enjoy. I tried to separate the sort and write function into more, and make the code more efficent but honestly I have a lot of assignments right now, and was short on time.

ANyways, not sure what else is supposed to go in here, but have a nice day!:)
